Analysis and visualization\n\n5.1 Figure out the relationship of educationLevel and Joviality\n\nOverall, we see from below that with the increasing of education level, people tend to have higher level of joviality as the lower bound and mean value of joviality has a trend to increase. Although we can also observe that for low level of education, the range is bigger that all other level, this might indicate longer social experience can still affect the upper bound of joviality, but enhancing education is still a more direct way to increase joviality level.\n\nThe plotThe codeThe statistics table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf <- f_data %>% group_by(participantId) %>% \n  summarise(total_edu=sum(Education),\n            total_food=sum(Food),\n            total_rec=sum(Recreation),\n            total_shl=sum(Shelter),\n            total_w=sum(Wage),\n            total_rent=sum(RentAdjustment),\n            total_saving=sum(Saving),\n            .groups = 'drop') %>%\n  as.data.frame()\ndf2 <- merge(x= df,y= p_data, by = \"participantId\")\n\nmy_sum <- df2 %>%\n  group_by(educationLevel) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n=n(),\n    mean=mean(joviality),\n    sd=sd(joviality)\n    ) %>%\n  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))\n\nggplot(my_sum) +\n  geom_errorbar(\n    aes(x=educationLevel, \n        ymin=mean-se, \n        ymax=mean+se), \n    width=0.2, \n    colour=\"black\", \n    alpha=0.9, \n    size=0.5) +\n  geom_point(aes\n           (x=educationLevel, \n            y=mean), \n           stat=\"identity\", \n           color=\"red\",\n           size = 1.5,\n           alpha=1) +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Low\", \"HighSchoolOrCollege\", \"Bachelors\", \"Graduate\")) +\n  ggtitle(\"Standard error of mean \n          Joviality score by educationLevel\")\n\n\n\n\nsumm <- my_sum[order(factor(my_sum$educationLevel, levels = c(\"Low\", \"HighSchoolOrCollege\", \"Bachelors\", \"Graduate\"))),c(\"educationLevel\",\"n\",\"mean\",\"sd\")]\nknitr::kable(head(summ), format = 'html')\n\n\n\n \n  \n    educationLevel \n    n \n    mean \n    sd \n  \n \n\n  \n    Low \n    84 \n    0.4868956 \n    0.2989496 \n  \n  \n    HighSchoolOrCollege \n    525 \n    0.4859899 \n    0.2858795 \n  \n  \n    Bachelors \n    232 \n    0.4975164 \n    0.2976517 \n  \n  \n    Graduate \n    170 \n    0.5162219 \n    0.2969368"
