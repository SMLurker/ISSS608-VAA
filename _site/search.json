Analysis and visualization\n\n5.1 Figure out the relationship of educationLevel and Joviality\n\nOverall, we see from below that with the increasing of education level, people tend to have higher level of joviality as the lower bound and mean value of joviality has a trend to increase. Although we can also observe that for low level of education, the range is bigger that all other level, this might indicate longer social experience can still affect the upper bound of joviality, but enhancing education is still a more direct way to increase joviality level.\n\nThe plotThe codeThe statistics table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf <- f_data %>% group_by(participantId) %>% \n  summarise(total_edu=sum(Education),\n            total_food=sum(Food),\n            total_rec=sum(Recreation),\n            total_shl=sum(Shelter),\n            total_w=sum(Wage),\n            total_rent=sum(RentAdjustment),\n            total_saving=sum(Saving),\n            .groups = 'drop') %>%\n  as.data.frame()\ndf2 <- merge(x= df,y= p_data, by = \"participantId\")\n\ndf3 <- fin_data %>%                              # Applying group_by & summarise\n  group_by(participantId) %>%\n  summarise(count_month = n_distinct(timestamp)) %>%\n  filter(count_month>1)\ndf4 <-merge(x=df3,y=df2, \n             by=\"participantId\", all.x=TRUE)\n\nmy_sum <- df4 %>%\n  group_by(educationLevel) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n=n(),\n    mean=mean(joviality),\n    sd=sd(joviality)\n    ) %>%\n  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))\n\nggplot(my_sum) +\n  geom_errorbar(\n    aes(x=educationLevel, \n        ymin=mean-se, \n        ymax=mean+se), \n    width=0.2, \n    colour=\"black\", \n    alpha=0.9, \n    size=0.5) +\n  geom_point(aes\n           (x=educationLevel, \n            y=mean), \n           stat=\"identity\", \n           color=\"red\",\n           size = 1.5,\n           alpha=1) +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Low\", \"HighSchoolOrCollege\", \"Bachelors\", \"Graduate\")) +\n  ggtitle(\"Standard error of mean \n          Joviality score by educationLevel\")\n\n\n\n\nsumm <- my_sum[order(factor(my_sum$educationLevel, levels = c(\"Low\", \"HighSchoolOrCollege\", \"Bachelors\", \"Graduate\"))),c(\"educationLevel\",\"n\",\"mean\",\"sd\")]\nknitr::kable(head(summ), format = 'html')\n\n\n\n \n  \n    educationLevel \n    n \n    mean \n    sd \n  \n \n\n  \n    Low \n    56 \n    0.4187639 \n    0.2937796 \n  \n  \n    HighSchoolOrCollege \n    422 \n    0.4346854 \n    0.2724155 \n  \n  \n    Bachelors \n    232 \n    0.4975164 \n    0.2976517 \n  \n  \n    Graduate \n    170 \n    0.5162219 \n    0.2969368 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Figure out the relationship of householdSize and Joviality\n\nFrom the plotting below, we see that number of householdSize does not have huge effect on the median of Joviality but there is still some slight impact that household with 2 or more people tend to have a middle or low level of joviality while one person are more intend to be either with high or low joviality\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = df4,\n  x = householdSize, \n  y = joviality,\n  type = \"np\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Money and Joviality\n\nfrom the graph below, we can find that the saving of most people are below 50000 within the study period.\n\ngghistostats(\n  data = df4,\n  x = total_saving,\n  type = \"bayes\",\n  test.value = 60,\n  xlab = \"total_saving\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd by plotting the ralationship of wages and joviality, we can high wages does not really mean for high joviality.\n\nggscatterstats(\n  data = df4,\n  x = total_w,\n  y = joviality,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 InterestGroup and Joviality\n\ntooltip <- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {\n  mean <- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem <- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"Mean Joviality scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\ngg_point <- ggplot(data=df4, \n                   aes(x = interestGroup),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = joviality, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  \n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  \n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  \n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = joviality),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )+\n  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.8))\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)"
